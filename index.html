<h2 class="subtitle">STRENGTHS </h2>
 <ol><li><b>Maximizer</b><br /><i>Excellence, not average, is your measure. Taking something from below
 average to slightly above average takes a great deal of effort and in your opinion is not very rewarding.
 Transforming something strong into something superb takes just as much effort but is much more thrilling.
 Strengths, whether yours or someone else's, fascinate you. Like a diver after pearls, you search them
 out, watching for the telltale signs of a strength. A glimpse of untutored excellence, rapid learning,
 a skill mastered without recourse to steps - all these are clues that a strength may be in play. And
 having found a strength, you feel compelled to nurture it, refine it, and stretch it toward excellence.
 You polish the pearl until it shines. This natural sorting of strengths means that others see you as
 discriminating. You choose to spend time with people who appreciate your particular strengths. Likewise,
 you are attracted to others who seem to have found and cultivated their own strengths. You tend to avoid 
 those who want to fix you and make you well rounded. You don't want to spend your life bemoaning what you
 lack. Rather, you want to capitalize on the gifts with which you are blessed. It's more fun. It's more 
 productive. And, counterintuitively, it is more demanding.</i></li>
 <li><b>Futuristic</b><br /><i>"Wouldn't it be great if..." You are the kind of person who loves to peer
 over the horizon. The future fascinates you. As if it were projected on the wall, you see in detail
 what the future might hold, and this detailed picture keeps pulling you forward, into tomorrow.
 While the exact content of the picture will depend on your other strengths and interests - a better
 product, a better team, a better life, or a better world - it will always be inspirational to you.
 You are a dreamer who sees visions of what could be and who cherishes those visions. When the present
 proves too frustrating and the people around you too pragmatic, you conjure up your visions of the
 future and they energize you. They can energize others, too. In fact, very often people look to you
 to describe your visions of the future. They want a picture that can raise their sights and thereby
 their spirits. You can paint it for them. Practice. Choose your words carefully. Make the picture as
 vivid as possible. People will want to latch on to the hope you bring.</i></li>
 <li><b>Harmony</b><br /><i>You look for areas of agreement. In your view there is little to be gained
 from conflict and friction, so you seek to hold them to a minimum. When you know that the people around
 you hold differing views, you try to find the common ground. You try to steer them away from
 confrontation and toward harmony. In fact, harmony is one of your guiding values. You can't quite
 believe how much time is wasted by people trying to impose their views on others. Wouldn't we all be
 more productive if we kept our opinions in check and instead looked for consensus and support? You
 believe we would, and you live by that belief. When others are sounding off about their goals, their
 claims, and their fervently held opinions, you hold your peace. When others strike out in a direction,
 you will willingly, in the service of harmony, modify your own objectives to merge with theirs (as long
 as their basic values do not clash with yours). When others start to argue about their pet theory or
 concept, you steer clear of the debate, preferring to talk about practical, down-to-earth matters on
 which you can all agree. In your view we are all in the same boat, and we need this boat to get where we
 are going. It is a good boat. There is no need to rock it just to show that you can.</i></li>
 <li><b>Woo</b><br /><i>Woo stands for winning others over. You enjoy the challenge of meeting new people 
 and getting them to like you. Strangers are rarely intimidating to you. On the contrary, strangers can 
 be energizing. You are drawn to them. You want to learn their names, ask them questions, and find some 
 area of common interest so that you can strike up a conversation and build rapport. Some people shy away 
 from starting up conversations because they worry about running out of things to say. You don't. Not 
 only are you rarely at a loss for words; you actually enjoy initiating with strangers because you derive 
 satisfaction from breaking the ice and making a connection. Once that connection is made, you are quite 
 happy to wrap it up and move on. There are new people to meet, new rooms to work, new crowds to mingle 
 in. In your world there are no strangers, only friends you havenâ€™t met yet - lots of them.</i></li>
 <li><b>Analytical</b><br /><i>Your Analytical theme challenges other people: "Prove it. Show me why what
 you are claiming is true." In the face of this kind of questioning some will find that their
 brilliant theories wither and die. For you, this is precisely the point. You do not necessarily
 want to destroy other people's ideas, but you do insist that their theories be sound. You see
 yourself as objective and dispassionate. You like data because they are value free. They have no
 agenda. Armed with these data, you search for patterns and connections. You want to understand
 how certain patterns affect one another. How do they combine? What is their outcome? Does this
 outcome fit with the theory being offered or the situation being confronted? These are your questions.
 You peel the layers back until, gradually, the root cause or causes are revealed. Others see you as
 logical and rigorous. Over time they will come to you in order to expose someone's "wishful thinking"
 or "clumsy thinking" to your refining mind. It is hoped that your analysis is never delivered too
 harshly. Otherwise, others may avoid you when that "wishful thinking" is their own.
