<h2 class="subtitle">SUMMARY </h2>
	<p>
	I am a senior studying Business Analytics &amp; Information Systems and German in Iowa City, Iowa.
	My coursework has included SQL in SQL Developer; Visual Basic in Visio as well as .NET exposure;
	data communications from hardware up to the application layer, including routing and IP addressing;
	and data mining with XLMiner to develop business intelligence and analyses, explain collected data,
	and predict future cases.
	I have had the opportunity to apply and learn hands-on as a Database Administrator for
	Principal Financial Group, and currently as a Desktop Support Specialist for University of Iowa
	Athletics IT.
	This summer I also began serving the Iowa Business Technology Association as President.
</p>
<p>
 I am excited by culture, languages, and broadening my perspectives by learning about the world.
 I have taken international business courses in entrepreneurship, management, and politics, and
 German courses in composition and conversation, as well as picking up languages in a handful of
 countries as I travel along.
 I had the opportunity to travel through Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland,
 and take business courses in finance and law near Venice, Italy.
